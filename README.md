Learning path tracer. Focusing on realism + performance.

Will use as a testbed for learning more advanced path tracing concepts, hopefully with a result of creating a really high-quality path tracer for CMU 15462.

Current features:
- [Ray Tracing in a Weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf)
- \[WIP\] [Ray Tracing: the Next Week](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing_%20The%20Next%20Week.pdf)
- Multithreaded rendering
- SIMD accelerated math + intersection testing
- GUI/CLI interfaces

Future:
- going through [pbrt](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html)
