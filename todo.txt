Optimizations To-Do:
	General:
		don't calculate position + normal for each nearer object, instead store object ID
		  and calculate after we have found the nearest object.

		sphere_moving_lane ? if we actually use them
		! aabb_lane

		looking into ray_lane again (didn't work first time, too divergent?? could have been buggy)
	math_simd.h:
		compare with and without const refs
	math.h:
