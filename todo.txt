fp:fast is causing NaN propagation

Performance: 640x480x128 - Debug-Optimized Build
	
	Base Scalar : 107s		{48s Release}
	SIMD v3     : 81.5s 	{29s Release}
	Inlining    : 29s		{29s}
	__vectorcall: 29s 		{29s}
	SIMD Spheres: 13s

Optimizations To-Do:
	General:
		looking into ray_lane again (didn't work first time, too divergent?? could have been buggy)
	math_simd.h:
		compare with and without const refs
	math.h:
